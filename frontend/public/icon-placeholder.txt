PWA Icons Required

To complete PWA setup, add the following icon files to the /public directory:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - Used for Android home screen and PWA manifest
   - Should be a square icon with CivicTrack branding

2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)
   - Used for splash screens and high-DPI displays
   - Should be a square icon with CivicTrack branding

You can generate these icons using:
- Online tools: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Design tools: Figma, Adobe Illustrator, etc.
- Or use a simple colored square with "CT" text as a placeholder

For now, the app will work without these icons, but PWA installation may not show a custom icon.
